# Publishing Your PWA

Once you've developed your PWA using the starter, it's time to publish your application to the web. 
This not only makes your PWA available through the browser, but also allows you to package your application for different app stores with <a href=#/builder/quick-start>PWABuilder.</a>

For now, we only have guidance for publishing with Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Pages, but will be adding additional routes in the future.

## Azure Static Web Apps

One option for deploying your PWA is Azure Static Web Apps, and can be set up in just minutes using the Azure command line tool.

You can download the Azure CLI <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">here.</a>

#### Prerequisites:

Some things you'll need before we get started:
  
* PWA source repository hosted on GitHub
  
* <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free"> Free Azure account </a>

#### Step by Step

1. Run `npm run deploy` in the root of your PWA source repository. This will trigger the Azure Static Web Apps CLI which will walk you through the process of deploying your app.
2. You will be asked to login to your Azure account.
3. After logging in, the [deploy command](https://azure.github.io/static-web-apps-cli/docs/cli/swa-deploy) will be called. 
4. When asked, ensure you use the default settings for your app, which can be found in the `swa-cli.config.json` file in the root of your app.
5. And thats it, finish following the prompts from the Azure Static Web Apps CLI and your app will be deployed to Azure.

#### Next Steps

You can trigger a new deployment of your PWA by commiting to the branch that your GitHub Action is associated with. Check the `Actions` tab for status of recent deployments.

## Github Pages

!> Built-in support for Github Pages was added to the Starter in June 2022. If you cloned the starter template before then, deploying to GitHub pages may not work by default.

Another quick and easy option for deploying your PWA is Github Pages. 

The Starter has a built in Workflow that will build your PWA for GitHub Pages entirely on the cloud, no pushing or pulling to the repo is necessary.

#### Prerequisites

Some things youâ€™ll need before we get started:

- Github account

- Personal version of the PWA Starter hosted on Github

#### Building For Deployment

First, let's bundle and build your PWA for deployment:

1. Go to your PWA's repository on GitHub.

2. Click the `Actions` tab.

3. Under `Workflows`, select `Deploy PWA Starter to GitHub Pages`.

4. Click `Run Workflow`

5. Wait for your build to complete. This should only take 1-2 minutes.

#### Enabling GitHub Pages

Once you have run the workflow, you can enable GitHub pages to display your site:

1. Go to the `Settings` tab in your PWA's repository.

2. Navigate to the `Pages` subsection.

3. Under `Source`, select `gh-pages` as your branch and `/ (root)` as your directory.

4. Click `Save`.
   
5. Your PWA will deploy to your personal Pages site!

</div>

#### Next Steps

You can trigger a new deployment by repeating the steps done in the ***Building for Deployment*** subsection.

If you want to set up automatic deployments, navigate to your `.github/workflows/main.yml` file and add this snippet on line 5:

```yml
push:
  branches:
    - main
```

This enables the *push* trigger for your workflow. Anytime you push to main, the workflow will be triggered.
